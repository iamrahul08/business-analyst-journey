- Their role is critical in understanding stakeholder needs, analyzing problems, and designing process or technical solutions.
- They are **change agents** — influencing positive transformation.

💡 Having this breakdown on your GitHub will let you **revise easily before interviews**, and prove you have a structured learning path.
